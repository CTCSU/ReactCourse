##### How to build page with React?

###### 1. Build with React CDN bundle JS file

###### 2. Build with React npm package

### How to build a modern front-end App, like React App?


#### Challenges

_An App, not a Page, usually means you need write hundreds of thousands lines of code. this case has couple of major challenges:_

1. How to manage big amount of files efficiently?
2. How to get support of Modular Programming?
3. How to get support of Dependency Management?
4. How to get benefit from open-source communities?
5. How to assure high code quality and high team productivity while increasing of code?

#### Recommended Dev Tools

###### Coding Phase
- [Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
>A lightweight but powerful source code editor, and built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js. [Why choice Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/whyvscode)?
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
>A popular runtime for JavaScript with great features like:
1. Built on V8 engine
2. Asynchronous event driven
3. Non-blocking I/O
4. HTTP & Stream first class
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
>A Node Package Manager. We use it to install other packages which our App depends from the npm public registry.
1. The Command Line Interface (CLI)
2. The public package registry

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
>A plug-able linting utility for JavaScript and JSX.


###### Package Phase
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
>A static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
1. Entry
2. Output
3. Loader
4. Plugin
5. Mode
6. Browser Compatibility
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
>We can use npm to publish our own package into public registry for sharing.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
>Babel is a JavaScript compiler.
Use next generation JavaScript, today. It is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Main features include:
1. Transform syntax.
2. Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through @babel/polyfill).
3. Source code transformations (codemods).
